# Belly Button Challenge
Module 14 Challenge

This project contained three parts. The first part was to create a bar chart to display the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) found in a specific individual test subject's navel (belly button). The second part was to create a bubble chart showing the number of bacteria for each OTU found in a specific individual test subject's navel. The third part was to display the metadata information for the selected individual test subject being shown in the charts.


## Part 1: Bar Chart

For the Test Subject ID selected from the dropdown menu, I created a bar chart with the following characteristics:
- OTU ID as the labels
- Number of that OTU ID present in the sample as the values
- Labels of the OTUs as the text shown when hovering over the specific bar in the bar chart

An example of the bar chart is shown below for Test Subject 956.

## Part 2: Bubble Chart

For the Test Subject ID selected from the dropdown menu, I created a bubble chart with the following characteristics:
- OTU ID on the x-axis
- Number of that OTU ID present in the sample on the y-axis
- Number of that OTU ID present in the sample also determined the size (radius) of the bubble
- OTU ID of the sample also determined the color of the bubble
- Labels of the OTUs as the text shown when hovering over the specific bar in the bar chart

An example of the bubble chart is shown below for Test Subject 956.

## Part 3: Demographic Info

For the Test Subject ID selected from the dropdown menu, I created a table to show the demographic info for that Test Subject, including:
- ID
- Ethnicity
- Gender
- Age
- Location
- BBType
- WFreq

An example of the demographic information is shown below for Test Subject 956.
